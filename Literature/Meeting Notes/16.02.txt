FSSR:

Interpret sample as source? 
Most likely no significant spatial resolution possible, since source is small and B/G is small.
In that case may as well use 2D geometry? That would require an adjustable b distance--> more complicated setup. 
Parts in the inventorlib? If adjustable parts, will need a strong support to hold camera weight. 
Use set parameters like with ADP spectrometer? But then will need to be able to set the a distance fairly exactly. 
Since TCC 200mm above the floor anyways, could set camera on bottom with crystal on top --> camera weight less precarious. 
Honestly I don't know what I don't know, will need guidance. Like can we just buy a lot of the complex parts (Justierunggeräte, angled mounts etc.)
or will we need to design ourselves? 
Just better to discuss in person tmr.
