Detector angle pointing towards source. Can do in Inventor fairly easily

There will always be significantly more rays hitting below (higher E) than above (lower E) on detector due to asymmetry. 
Just shift detector so that as many rays hit as possible and adjust the central energy so that stay within desired E
range despite asymmetry. 

How much to shift the detector by can be decided by code. It refers to the shift in distance along x axis.
