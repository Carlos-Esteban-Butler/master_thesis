1. Look at simulation results.
2. Briefly review outline.
3. Build very general outline together for proposal.

---------------------------------------------

Include KAP? To what degree?
Kein KAP im Proposal, erst dann in der Masterarbeit, weil Spektren

Use a smaller section to generally go over basics of our design. For example. With ADP describe the rationale behind tilt and two channels, along with
two holes in filter holder.

--------------------------------------------------------

Write Theory part first, since then can just start writing. Introduction probs at the end

Read paper where got mica data more carefully. Can push until later, is qualitative anyways

Interesting graph in challenges of xray spectroscopy paper

Maybe need to calculate how much y dist on crystal actually lands on detector. Seems to be effecting the resolution with the ADP

Dispersion calc for FSSR nicely lines up with simulation
