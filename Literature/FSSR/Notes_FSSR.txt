vertical = saggital = focusing
horizontal = meridional = dispersive
rowland circle geometry ensures focusing of both detector and source,
radius of crystal equal to radius of circle

Mica crystals useful bc can cover a wide range of wavelengths (good reflectivity across a wide range)
Disadvantage: not a perfect crystal --> lower resolution

Spectral resolution also controlled by sensitivity of detector and the size of the plasma source
(optimally use a point source. In our case not possible since use a wire or foil as a source)

Advantage of FSSR: obtain simultaneously high spectral and spatial resolution due to focusing 
from spherical crystal
