Detector angle resulting from calculation makes no sense (-80 degrees), rays don't even hit the detector.
Angle of 10 degrees looks surprisingly good. Only question is if we get a Bildverzerrung out of it.

FSSR effectively works as a pinhole, bc of the filtering for wavelength --> less interference between each image. 

Taking perpendicular (0 degrees) is best. Then avoids aberrations
