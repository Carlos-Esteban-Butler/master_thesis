\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

This thesis would not have been possible without the help of many people. I'd like to thank the plasma physics/PHELIX group at GSI in general for taking me in and supporting me, and of course for the fun times. In particular I want to thank my supervisor Philipp Hesselbach, M.Sc., who supported me every step of the way and offered invaluable advice, and Dr. Paul Neumayer, who gave continued support throughout the thesis, as well as Prof. Dr. Vincent Bagnoud for giving me the opportunity and accommodating my ever-changing plans. The spectrometer designs benefited from the helpful input of Dr. Artem Martynenko, who also gave me great advice and help with the analysis of spectrometer data. The always stressful beamtime was successful (and often fun) thanks to the awesome experiment team of Philipp, Paul, Dr. Zsuzsanna Major, Dr. Bernhard Zielbauer, and Alice Renaux. I'd also like the thank my office roommates Ren√© Kalla, Sarah Grimm, Alice, Pierre Lebegue, and Jannis Lutz for the great conversations and dumb jokes. I hope to see all of you again and have you try more of my desserts.

I wouldn't have reached this point in my studies without the help of my family, especially my mom, dad, and siblings, who supported my decisions and were always there for me, during my studies and well before that. A very special shout out goes to my (newly-minted) wife Yan Yi. I don't know what I would do without you.
