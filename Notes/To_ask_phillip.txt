	Levy for XANES, paper from philipp for exafs (schmelzen on Al anstatt WDM)

What is meant by quantify efficiency of bent crystals?

For flat crystal would be lower SNR?

Unsure about ordering of sections in fundamentals. Maybe have short paragraph in introduction to section
outlining the main properties of a spectrometer?

name for KAP

	SUCC 

Standard appendix style?

Can implement the measurement procudure stuff into the general setup. Don't need a section

explain HIHEX experimental scheme with general experimental scheme as a picture in introduction where 
SIS and PHELIX are introduced
